# 💡Reflection
The industrial visit to Johor Port Berhad helped me realise that IT is one of the main backbones of large-scale operations. The port’s daily activities depend heavily on integrated digital systems such as the Terminal Operating System (TOS), ERP platforms, and data analytics tools to ensure smooth, efficient, and accurate operations. Without a reliable IT infrastructure, it would be difficult to manage the high volume of logistics activities and maintain operational continuity.

In addition, the visit showed how strong cybersecurity measures and resilient infrastructure, such as dual data centers and continuous monitoring, are essential to prevent system failures and security threats. I also learned that technical knowledge alone is not sufficient, as communication, adaptability, and teamwork are equally important in an industry environment. Overall, this visit deepened my understanding of how IT supports real-world industrial operations and motivated me to strengthen both my technical skills and professional mindset for the future.
