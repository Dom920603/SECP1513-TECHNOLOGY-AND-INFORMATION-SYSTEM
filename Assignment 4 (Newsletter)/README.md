# 💡Reflection
The industrial visit to Johor Port Berhad helped me realise that IT plays a key role as the backbone of large-scale operations. The port relies heavily on digital systems to manage daily logistics, monitor performance, and keep operations running smoothly. Seeing how these systems work in a real environment made me better understand the importance of having a strong and reliable IT infrastructure.

The visit also showed that technology alone is not enough, as cybersecurity, communication, and teamwork are equally important. Overall, this experience gave me a clearer picture of how IT supports real-world industries and motivated me to continue developing both my technical skills and professional mindset.
