# 💡Reflection
After visiting Johor Port Berhad, I realised that the IT department is one of the main backbones of large-scale operations. The port’s daily activities rely heavily on integrated digital systems such as the Terminal Operating System (TOS), ERP platforms, and data analytics tools to ensure smooth, efficient, and accurate operations. Without these systems, daily operations would become disorganised and inefficient.

The visit also highlighted the importance of strong cybersecurity measures and resilient infrastructure, such as dual data centers and continuous monitoring, in preventing system failures and security threats. Moreover, the speaker emphasised that effective communication and collaboration are mandatory soft skills in the industry, as they help ensure operations run smoothly. Overall, this visit deepened my understanding of how IT supports real-world industrial operations and strengthened my interest in the IT field.
